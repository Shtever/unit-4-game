In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a game where the user was given 4 crystals [changed to Ninja Turtles] with hidden random values, the sum of which would be added together. The goal of the game is for the user to reach the randomly generated number displayed (between 19 and 130) without going over. A scoreboard keeps track of total wins and losses.
